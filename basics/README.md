#### Whenever we are creating a Tkinter GUI application we should first remind ourselves of the following main concepts:
    - Importing the tkinter & widgets & function related libraries
    - Define a window
    - Define functions
    - Define image color cariables if possible so that they can be reused
    - Define frames
    - Run root window's main loop
